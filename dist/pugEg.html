        <h1>Jade Intro.</h1>
        <p>Clean and Classy!</p>
        <h2>Text and Comments</h2>
        <p>
            Text inside
            <em>paragraph</em>
            tag
        </p>
        <p>Multi Line</p>
        <p>Another way for large bodies of text!</p>
        <!-- HTML Comments visible in HTML source-->
        <!-- block comments| this piece of text won't be visible.
| as this is part of the HTML block comments.
-->
        <h2>IDs and Classes</h2>
        <div id="content"><p class="description">`p` with a class of description inside a `div` with an id of content. You can simply omit the div btw.</p></div>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <!-- for boolean attributes you can pass true/false or omit them-->
        <!-- Multi lines ?-->
        <!-- No commas ?-->
        <input type="checkbox" name="terms" checked="checked" />
        <h2>Nesting</h2>
        <!-- We will do some nesting now| Lesser nesting ? ok .. cool!
-->
        <ul id="menu">
            <li><a href="#target1" title="Home">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#target2" title="Contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Variables and Escaping</h2>
        <!-- Ok .. time to learn the real stuff now!| Let's say you passed some variables to this template
| from your Node.js code. Since we don't have a node.js setup
| we're going to set the variables inside here.
| yes! you can define variables in jade templates!

| want more text in the heading ?
| arrays ? objects ?

| One thing to remember though. Jade will html escape
| the contents of #{}. If you want unescaped content
| use !{}
| Also notice i escaped all interpolation tokens in this
| block comment, else Jade would think that it needs to
| do some string interpolation and throw errors!

| That's all for now! In the next part I am going to
| show you some other features like conditionals, mixins
| and loops.

        <h3>Jade is a templating engine</h3>
    </body>
</html>
<!-- Let's first see how to inject JS logic into your JADE templates-->
<!-- JADE supports its own constructs for conditionals and loops to make your templates cleaner :) Let's see it in action!-->
<h2>Users</h2>
<!-- Neat! There's another construct called `each`-->
<!-- Also there is `unless` which is equivalent to if (!expr)-->
<!-- Let's use that and swap a bit of code-->
<p>foo is an "admin"</p>
<p>bar is not an "admin"</p>
<p>baz is not an "admin"</p>
<!-- Let's take a look at `case` statements now-->
<h3>case</h3>
<p>User is a technician</p>
<h3>mixins</h3>
<!-- mixins are pieces of code that you can reuse as functions. they may or may not accept arguments-->
<h2>Fruits</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Apple</li>
    <li>Banana</li>
    <li>Orange</li>
</ul>
<!-- Another way to call mixins that provides with a few extra features that you're going to see in a second.-->
<!-- The attributes, id, class have been added to the li's. You can style them from CSS now.-->
<li attributes="attributes">foo has a role of admin</li>
<li attributes="attributes">bar has a role of manager</li>
<li attributes="attributes">baz has a role of technician</li>
<!-- Mixins are excellent for dropdowns-->
<select>
    <option value="#{name}">foo</option>
    <option value="#{name}">bar</option>
    <option value="#{name}">baz</option>
</select>
<!-- Great! Now finally let's take a look at "filters". filters must be prefixed with ':',-->
<!-- for example ':coffeescript' or ':markdown'. Jade currently supports :stylus, :less, :markdown, :cdata and :coffeescript.-->
<!-- Let's see how to use the coffee filter.-->
